Simple neural network implementation

Two category of data

1. x: list of number with range (0.0 - 0.1), y: 0
2. x: list of number with range (0.9 - 1.0), y: 1

Train the neural network so it can identity data 
similar to case (1) as 0, and case (2) as 1

To run the programme:

cargo run [save] [train] [load]

Parameter
1. save (save the result (weight and bais) into /store_data.json)
2. load (load the saved data (weight and bais) to dense layer)
3. train (check if train the dense layer, if already passed load, can 
skip this)
